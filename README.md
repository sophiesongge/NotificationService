## Installation

You need `npm` installed, then run the following commands from the root of the repository to install the required tools and dependencies:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g bower
npm install
bower install
```

You can use `grunt live` to have a live preview of the code in your browser.
You can use `grunt build` to build the release (into dist/) that can be then embedded into the dist/war folder of the scheduler.
